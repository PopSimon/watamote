もう40日間学校で喋っていない I haven't talked for 40 days at school.
だけど別に寂しくない。 But I don't really feel lonely at all.
なぜなら高校生の本分は勉強であり After all my duty as a high school student is to study.

Mojo.

My first midterm exam is around the corner. I've to get some solid results...
It's Not My Fault That I'm Not Popular!
This is the story of an unpopular high schooler...
大反響第2回目!モテない女子の苦悩 The second chapter of the rumored manga! The woes of an unpopular girl!

I'm sure a lot of people will come to me.
ここ教えて = How do I solve this?
えっとここはね = Uh, about this problem...
黒木さんって頭いいんだよね = Kuroki-san, you are so smart!

Speaking of which, the exams are knocking on the door.
Did you start studying already?
Nope, not at all.

02
Wanna study at some family restaurant after school?
What was that? You two are gonna study alone?

We'll be going.
What?! Are you coming?

This is just my personal desire... But can't some terrorist go amok here?
Or at least can't the shorty alien from GANTZ attack them? Or Shimada from Parasyte (after he's covered in acid) would appear in front of them?
The story of indifferent days.

2nd gloom: I'm shy and not popular at all.
Tanigawa Nico

03
Don't feel like going to club practice...

Oh?
Kuroki, be careful on your way home.
My homeroom teacher?!

Yep.
See you.

04
It has been so long that someone talked to me at school...
I couldn't even say "Good-bye."

Tomoko! I'm off to shopping. Is there anything you want to eat?
Huh? Cooked pork...

05
All right. Bye then.
I can talk to my mom just fine...

No, no. Being a shut-in has nothing to do with your parents.
The real important thing is holding a conversation with others. Especially with guys.

I've to talk to someone so I get the feeling of talking I had in middle school back.

The man who is closest to me physically and age wise is...

06
My brother!
Let's talk.

What?

Don't wanna. And don't just waltz in my room.

07
Phew...
Don't make yourself feel too comfortable here.

Come on, I'm your sister.
Just get out.

Huh? Was my brother that unfriendly?
We playe games together not that long ago.
一年前くらい = About a year ago.

Ah. Wanna play Wii?
No. Get out now.

Oh right. What about your club activities?
On break because of exams and now shoo!

Oh and...
Stop looking for something!
Die!

08
Ah...

Okay. I'll kill myself.
No... (Hold on a sec)

You were just a bit annoying, so it slipped...
You know, I've been thinking about this...

When you're in high school, the your life would be more difficult...
Guess it's on hard mode right now.

09
After this when I go to university and graduate afterwards it will be on nightmare.
In that case I should go for the end.
Sorry I said too much. Calm down now.

You wanted something from me, no?

Talk with me.
What's that supposed to mean?

I came to realize that I haven't talked to anyone lately.

Because of that I've been only talking with my family.
Why?

So as a measure of rehabilitation talk to me everyday for an hour!
I really don't want that...

10
I don't know about your situation, but why don't you talk to your friends?
Do you think I have friends?

There isn't anyone who has no friends.

The words of a forward, regular for two years of the soccer team weight different after all.
Why are you so polite?!

It's that, isn't it? The FW of the soccer team gets to bone the manager of the team so he'll definitely score a goal, right?
What kind of team is that?

After the rugby team, it's the second notorious team with a lot of scandals regarding the other sex, isn't it?
Do you have some bad memories with the soccer team or what?

11
Well? What's your decision? Or I'm gonna kill myself.
If you were my brother, I'd have punched you in the face...

By the way when...
When do you think you'll get a boyfriend?

Isn't this kind of life long imprisonment for you?
No, I think I'll find someone in a month.
I didn't expect you to be this optimistic...

So what do you want to talk with me?

Am I cute?

12
Normal.
Define normal. Above average? Above average? Above average?
Will we talk about that everyday? You've got to be kidding me!

Three days later.
Don't you have anything to ask?

もう43日間学校で喋っていない I haven't talked for 43 at school.

13
The class is over.

Ah...
Ah...
G-Good... Good bye..
Uh... Hee... he...

14
Bye! Be careful on your way back.

Yay! I totally hold a normal conversation!
I'll buy ice cream on my way back!

15
Guess I'll buy for my brother as well.
It's kinda thanks to him after all.
All right!

It'll be 332 yen.

Do you want a spoon?
Ah! Mm.

16
M...
It's okay...
Sorry?

I'll put it in then.
What?
Uh... Well... No need...

Shit! I talked with such a hot guy!
Is it okay to call that a real conversation?!
