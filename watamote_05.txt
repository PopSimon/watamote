mourning 5: i'm not popular so i'll hole up here

i ended up laughing so suddenly, i wasn't seen was i?

02/70
i won't be able to go to that convenience store for a while

but that joke was the best!
that scene where the main character got naked and kept saying 'i'm sorry, i'm sorry" in front of his ancestor's gravestone while rubbing his genitals on it.

huh...
what!?

03/71
if it was going to be like this, i should have bought an umbrella from the convenience store

well, it seems like it's just a passing shower, so i'll head back once it leats up

what is this all of sudden+?
forget about it just run.

this is the worst.
it started coming down all of a sudden after all

04/72
wh, why here?
i'm here already, so go somewhere else!

or maybe i should be the one running away from here?
hey there?

are you also trying to escape the rain?

what?

05/73
they talked to me? why!? oh no!! my mind's a blank!!
what are you doing, suddenly talking to her like that? you're bothering her.
huh? it's fine, no big deal. I'm bored anyway.

oh? am i perhaps being ignored?
quit it... she's a quiet girl, obviously.
you're wrong!! i'm not ignoring you, and i'M not a quiet girl!
i'm actually cheergul and interesting!!

in any case, i've got to say something

i.. it's raining isn't it!!
ahahaha...

06/74
... ah yeah... that's true isn't it

it's no good!! i'm already at my limit!! it's hard to breathe!!

what is this swat!? is this a basketball manga or something!?

07/75
i don't mean to get ahead of myself. but "is this a basketball manga or something?" is a funny punchline isn't it!!
yeah,if i tell it to those people over there they might laugh. they might think i'm an interesting girl...

all right!

ah... ah!!
thi-
this is some crazy sweating!
thi, this is just like some kind of basketball manga!!

08/76

huh!? augh...!!

wha- wha, what is this swrat!?
i'm swating like some kind of ba-ba-basketball manga character!!

what? oh, are you telling me by any chance?

just kill me now.

09/77
what's with them, geez.
i bet they're normally entertained by shitty, boring perverted jokes
do you laugh at those impressions on tv?
it's because of that you don't get such a highlevel gag!!

oh man... this isn't good. if i stay here i'm going to edn up crying...
bathroom... the bathroom...

the rain's still strong, are you going to go home?

ah... umm..
they're going to find out i'm crying, i've got to say something funny!!

ba-ba-ba
bathroom...
i was thinking of taking a crazy dump or something...

10/78
oh, i'm sorry... for having asked that...
no!? that was a l-lie
i'm going to p-pee
even though it was a gag!! even though i lowered it to a dirty joke!!

i can't get rid of this swelling

but if i don't go back they'll really thing i'm taking a dump

11/79

12/80
ah great, she's still here

isn't seh sleeping? should we wake her up?
no. it's fine. let's just leave the umbrella here

but, going all the way to the convenience store, buying an umbrella, and coming back...
i mean, it seems like the rain won't srop according to the forecast on my phone so...

it'll seem like we just left here though won't it?
well, that's fine i guess

will she even notice it?
it's right at her feet, she'll probably notice, i'm sure


13/81

an umbrella?
huh?
something like this was left here?

i, is it all right if i use it, i wonder? it's not stealing is it?

sigh...

just once, i want to be treated kindly by a boy...
